# Open Source Preferences
IMO:
1. Bazaar > Cathedral
1. Open Development > Private Discussions
2. Community Project >  Single entity controlled
3. Simple Project structure/dependency > Mixing two or more languages > Anything with >1k lines of dependency (aka ~~most~~  Every javascript projects)
4. Simple coding tools/practices -> easier for new players to manipulate source code
5. Also, Clean architecture is a huge bonus
6. Having design philosophy > Not have > Just merging everything into a bloated zombie that no one can fully understand
7. Having overall guidelines can make sure new comers can confidently submit new functionality that meets the philosophy 
8. Having good document > CRAP document
9. GPL > BSD
