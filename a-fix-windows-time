#Warning: The system is configured to read the RTC time in the local time zone.
#This mode cannot be fully supported. It will create various problems
#with time zone changes and daylight saving time adjustments. The RTC
#time is never updated, it relies on external facilities to maintain it.
#If at all possible, use RTC in UTC by calling
#'timedatectl set-local-rtc 0'.
